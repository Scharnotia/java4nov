Describe the categorization of operators in JavaScript based on their functionality. Provide examples for
each category.


Operators in JavaScript can be categorized based on their functionality into several groups:

1. Arithmetic Operators: These operators are used for performing arithmetic calculations on numeric values.

Addition (+)
Subtraction (-)
Multiplication (*)
Division (/)
Modulus (%)
Exponentiation (**)
Example
let a = 10;
let b = 5;
let sum = a + b; // Addition
let difference = a - b; // Subtraction
let product = a * b; // Multiplication
let quotient = a / b; // Division
let remainder = a % b; // Modulus
let result = a ** b; // Exponentiation

2.Assignment Operators: These operators are used to assign values to variables.

Assignment (=)
Compound assignment operators (e.g., +=, -=, *=, /=)
Example:
let x = 10;
x += 5; // Equivalent to x = x + 5

3.Comparison Operators: These operators are used to compare values and return a Boolean result.

Equal to (==)
Not equal to (!=)
Strict equal to (===)
Strict not equal to (!==)
Greater than (>)
Less than (<)
Greater than or equal to (>=)
Less than or equal to (<=)
Example:
let x = 10;
let y = 5;
console.log(x > y); // true

4. Logical Operators: These operators are used to perform logical operations on Boolean values.

Logical AND (&&)
Logical OR (||)
Logical NOT (!)
Example:
let isSunny = true;
let isWarm = false;
console.log(isSunny && isWarm); // false

5.Unary Operators: These operators act on a single operand.

Increment (++)
Decrement (--)
Unary plus (+)
Unary minus (-)
Logical NOT (!)
Example:
let a = 5;
console.log(++a); // 

6.Conditional (Ternary) Operator: This operator provides a concise way to write conditional statements.

Conditional (ternary) operator (? :)
Example:
let age = 20;
let status = (age >= 18) ? 'Adult' : 'Minor';
