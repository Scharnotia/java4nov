Differentiate between unary, binary, and ternary operators in JavaScript. Give examples of each.

1. Unary Operators:

Unary operators act on a single operand.
They perform operations like incrementing/decrementing a value, converting a value's sign, or negating a boolean value.
Examples:
let x = 5;
let y = -x;     // Unary minus operator
let z = ++x;    // Unary increment operator
let w = !true;  // Unary logical NOT operator

2. Binary Operators:

Binary operators act on two operands.
They perform operations like arithmetic calculations, comparisons, logical operations, etc.
Examples:
let a = 5;
let b = 3;
let sum = a + b;  // Binary addition operator
let product = a * b;  // Binary multiplication operator
let isEqual = (a === b);  // Binary strict equality operator

3.Ternary Operator:

The ternary operator is a unique operator in JavaScript.
It acts on three operands and is often used as a shorthand for if-else statements.
Syntax: condition ? expression1 : expression2

If the condition is true, expression1 is evaluated.
If the condition is false, expression2 is evaluated.
Example:
let age = 20;
let status = (age >= 18) ? 'Adult' : 'Minor';
