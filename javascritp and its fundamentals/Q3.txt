 List and describe the five primitive data types in JavaScript.

 In JavaScript, there are five primitive data types:

1. String: Strings represent textual data and are enclosed in single ('') or double ("") quotes. They can contain letters, numbers, symbols, and whitespace.

2. Number: Numbers represent numeric data, including integers and floating-point numbers (decimal numbers). They can be positive, negative, or zero.

3. Boolean: Booleans represent logical values, either true or false. They are commonly used in conditional statements and boolean expressions.

4. Undefined: Undefined represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value. It is also the default value for variables that have not been initialized. 

5. Null: Null represents the intentional absence of any value. It is typically used to explicitly indicate that a variable does not point to any object or value.
