Discuss the precedence and associativity of operators in JavaScript. Why is understanding these concepts
important?

1. Precedence:

Precedence determines the order in which operators are evaluated in an expression.
Operators with higher precedence are evaluated before operators with lower precedence.
Parentheses can be used to override the default precedence and explicitly specify the order of evaluation.
JavaScript follows a set of precedence rules to determine the order of evaluation.
Example:
let result = 2 + 3 * 4;  // Multiplication (*) has higher precedence than addition (+)
// The above expression is equivalent to 2 + (3 * 4), resulting in 14
 
 2.Associativity:

Associativity defines the order in which operators of the same precedence are evaluated when they appear in an expression.
It can be either left-to-right (left associative) or right-to-left (right associative).
Most operators in JavaScript are left-associative, meaning they are evaluated from left to right.
Some operators, such as the assignment operators (=, +=, -=, etc.) and the ternary conditional operator (?:), are right-associative, meaning they are evaluated from right to left.
Example:
let result = 10 - 5 - 2;  // Subtraction (-) is left-associative
// The above expression is equivalent to (10 - 5) - 2, resulting in 3

Understanding precedence and associativity is important for several reasons:

Correctness: Knowing the order in which operators are evaluated ensures that expressions are computed correctly according to the intended logic.

Readability: Code that adheres to standard precedence and associativity rules is easier for other developers to understand and maintain.

Avoiding Errors: Incorrect assumptions about precedence and associativity can lead to logic errors and unexpected behavior in programs. Explicitly using parentheses when necessary can help prevent such errors.

Optimization: Understanding precedence and associativity can also aid in writing more efficient code by minimizing the use of unnecessary parentheses and ensuring that expressions are evaluated in the most efficient manner.
